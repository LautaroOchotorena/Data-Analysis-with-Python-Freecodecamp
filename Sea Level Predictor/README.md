# Sea Level Predictor

The **objective** is to analyze a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880 and predict the sea level change through year 2050.

[**Instructions**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Sea%20Level%20Predictor/Instructions.md) are provided.

[**epa sea level**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Sea%20Level%20Predictor/epa-sea-level.csv) is the **dataset**.

[**Sea level predictor**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Sea%20Level%20Predictor/sea_level_predictor.py) is where I did the work and the following **image** is created due to this one [**sea level plot**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Sea%20Level%20Predictor/sea_level_plot.png).

The file [**main**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Sea%20Level%20Predictor/main.py) runs the work done and also a [**test**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Sea%20Level%20Predictor/test_module.py) to be sure I completed the objective.
