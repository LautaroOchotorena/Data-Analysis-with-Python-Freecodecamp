# Page View Time Series Visualizer

The **objective** is to visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart and box plots.

[**Instructions**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Page%20View%20Time%20Series%20Visualizer/Instructions.md) are provided.

[**fcc forum pageviews**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Page%20View%20Time%20Series%20Visualizer/fcc-forum-pageviews.csv) is the **dataset**.

[**Time series visualizer**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Page%20View%20Time%20Series%20Visualizer/time_series_visualizer.py) is where I did the work and the following **images** are created due to this one [**barplot**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Page%20View%20Time%20Series%20Visualizer/bar_plot.png), [**boxplot**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Page%20View%20Time%20Series%20Visualizer/box_plot.png) and [**lineplot**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Page%20View%20Time%20Series%20Visualizer/line_plot.png).

The file [**main**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Page%20View%20Time%20Series%20Visualizer/main.py) runs the work done and also a [**test**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Page%20View%20Time%20Series%20Visualizer/test_module.py) to be sure I completed the objective.

You can also **check it out** [**here**](https://replit.com/@LautaroOchotore/Page-View-Time-Series-Visualizer), to run it you have to be logged in and fork the proyect.
