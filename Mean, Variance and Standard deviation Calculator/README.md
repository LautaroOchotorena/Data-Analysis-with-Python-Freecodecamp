# Mean, Variance and Standard deviation Calculator

The **objective** is to use Numpy to create a certain type of output.

[**Instructions**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Mean%2C%20Variance%20and%20Standard%20deviation%20Calculator/Instructions.md) are provided.

[**Mean, var, std**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Mean%2C%20Variance%20and%20Standard%20deviation%20Calculator/mean_var_std.py) is where I did the work.

The file [**main**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Mean%2C%20Variance%20and%20Standard%20deviation%20Calculator/main.py) runs the work done and also a [**test**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Freecodecamp/blob/main/Mean%2C%20Variance%20and%20Standard%20deviation%20Calculator/test_module.py) to be sure I completed the objective.
